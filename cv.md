### Education
**BSc in Theoretical Computer Science** | University of Sarajevo
*Expected Graduation: July 2025*

### Research Experience

**CaCTüS Intern** | MPI for Biological Cybernetics | *Tübingen, July – September 2024*
*   Applied dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to analyze calcium imaging data from zebrafish larvae brains, aiming for data-driven discovery of functional subnetworks.
*   Extracted significant spatiotemporal patterns, notably oscillatory dynamics in the optic tectum potentially reflecting winner-take-all circuit mechanisms.
*   Demonstrated DMD's advantage in capturing coupled spatial and temporal neural dynamics compared to traditional methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, DFT).
*   Contributed to research within the RoLi Lab (Drs. Drew Robson & Jennifer Li), supervised by Dr. Sophie Aimon.
*   Selected for a competitive program with a 1.35% acceptance rate in 2024.

**PSI Project Participant** | ANNT | *Sarajevo, July – December 2023*
*   Investigated uncertainty quantification techniques, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and history matching (HM), for agent-based models in a UROP-like project.
*   Critically reviewed scientific literature and presented findings on UQ approaches.
*   Organized by Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology (ANNT). Supervised by Dr. Kenan Šehić.

### Industry Experience

**Math Expert** | Mercor | *October 2024 – Present*
*   Training LLM models (correcting their responses and providing solutions on which these models can be trained on) to solve math problems, covering high school to olympiad level problems.

**AI/ML Intern** | One Thousand | *Berlin, February – April 2025*
*   Developed and maintained components for automating business document processing (e.g., invoices, offers) workflows using Python, FastAPI, and LLM APIs.
*   Applied prompt engineering techniques for structured information extraction from documents.
*   Contributed to short-term projects including predictive modeling for demand forecasting and automated web data gathering for lead generation support.
*   Utilized Git for version control and gained practical experience with software development practices in a fast-paced startup environment.
