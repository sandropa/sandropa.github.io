Hi, I'm Sandro Parad≈æik. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently a BSc student in Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Sarajevo (expected graduation: July 2025). My core academic and professional interests lie at the vibrant intersection of **Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML)**.

I'm driven by the power of mathematical principles to develop intelligent systems and extract meaningful insights from complex data. This passion has led me to:
*   Dive into research, such as my work at the **MPI for Biological Cybernetics** applying dynamic mode decomposition to zebrafish brain data, and exploring uncertainty quantification techniques for agent-based models with **ANNT**.
*   Gain industry experience, currently as a **Math Expert at Mercor** training LLMs for advanced mathematical problem-solving, and previously as an **AI/ML Intern at One Thousand** where I developed components for automating business document processing using Python, FastAPI, and LLM APIs.
*   Share my enthusiasm for mathematics by **teaching and mentoring** gifted students for competitions through the Math School for Gifted Students and MetaMath.

This website serves as a hub for my thoughts, projects, and professional journey. Here you'll find:
*   My detailed **[Curriculum Vitae](/cv/)** for a comprehensive look at my background.
*   **Blog posts** where I'll share insights, tutorials, and discussions on topics spanning mathematics, AI, ML, and computer science.
*   Updates on my personal projects, like explorations into [Markov Decision Processes using Linear Programming](#) and the [Cutting Stock Problem](#) (links will point to blog posts soon!).

I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and discuss new ideas. Feel free to connect with me:
